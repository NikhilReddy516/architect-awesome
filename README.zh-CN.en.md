### LSM tree

LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Trees) and a B + tree as compared trades performance for performance part read to write (write through bulk), between the reader's implemented.
Hbase, LevelDB, Tair (Long DB), nessDB LSM using a tree structure. LSM can be quickly indexed.

* [ "LSM VS B + Tree Tree"] (https://blog.csdn.net/dbanote/article/details/8897599)
 * B + tree good read performance, but because of the need ordered structure, when the key scattered, disk seek frequent, resulting in write performance.
* LSM is to split a tree into N little tree, first write to memory (seek no problem, high performance), ordered to build a small tree (ordered tree) in memory, along with the trees to larger trees will flush memory to disk. When reading data because they do not know where trees small tree, it must traverse (binary search) all the trees, but the data inside each tablet trees are ordered.
 
* [ "LSM tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree) Storage Engine"] (https://blog.csdn.net/u014774781/article/details/52105708)
 * Extreme to say, based on the write performance of the LSM tree HBase achieve an order of magnitude higher than MySQL, read an order of magnitude lower performance.
 * Optimizations: Bloom filter alternative binary search; compact decimal trees, improve query performance.
* Hbase in the memory reaches a certain threshold, to flush the entire disk, a file form (B + number), the HDFS update operation is not supported, so the entire flush Hbase do not merge update. flush into the trees on the disk, regularly merged into a tree.

## Bloom filter

Commonly used in large data duplication, such as email, url like.
The core principle: each of the data generated by computing a fingerprint (a byte or more, but certainly much less than the original data), which are each obtained by a random calculation, in mapping a large fingerprint to bitwise storage space. Note: There is a certain error rate.
Advantages: space and time efficiency are high.
Disadvantages: With the increase in the number of elements deposited, miscalculation rate increases.

### transaction ACID properties
* [ "Database transaction ACID properties"] (https://blog.csdn.net/u012440687/article/details/52116108)

### transaction isolation level

* Uncommitted read: a transaction can read uncommitted data of another situation prone to dirty read.
* Reading submit: A separate transaction such as a transaction after the submission can read the data, but the situation will not repeat the read (inconsistent data read many times), UPDATE operation occurs during reading, it will be more. (Most database default level is RC, such as SQL Server, Oracle), when reading can not be modified.
* Repeatable read: Make sure to read every time the same transaction, the acquired data is the same, but does not protect the original data is updated by other transactions (phantom read), Mysql InnoDB is this level.
* Serialization: All things serial processing (at the expense of efficiency)

## Lock

### Java locking and synchronization in class

* [ "Java in the lock Classification"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/qifengshi/p/6831055.html)
 * Includes synchronized, ReentrantLock, and ReadWriteLock.

 * Application with acquire, do not apply the obstruction; release by release.

* [ "Java development of Mutex vs Semaphore"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/davidwang456/p/6094947.html)
 * Simply means that the Mutex is exclusive, only one can get to the resource, Semaphore also have exclusive, but you can define multiple resource objects can be obtained. 

### Fair Lock & Lock unfair

The role of fair lock is in strict accordance with the order of thread starts to execute, it does not allow other threads of execution to jump the queue; rather than equitable lock is allowed to jump the queue.

* [ "Fair locking and non-locking fair"] (https://blog.csdn.net/EthanWhite/article/details/55508357)
* By default ReentrantLock are unfair and synchronized lock. ReentrantLock fair can be set to lock.

### pessimistic locking 

If improper use pessimistic locking (the number of locks too), can cause large service area to wait. Recommended priority optimistic locking and retry.

* [ "[MySQL] & optimistic pessimistic locking lock"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiqian-ali/p/6200874.html)

### optimistic locking & CAS

* [ "An implementation of optimistic locking --CAS"] (http://www.importnew.com/20472.html)
 * MySQL and optimistic locking in a similar manner, and merely by comparing the original value. 

### ABA problem

Due to the high concurrency, at CAS, after this update may BEING A A. It can be solved by version number, similar to the optimistic locking Mysql above mentioned.

### CopyOnWrite container

It can be read concurrently on CopyOnWrite container, without the need for locking. CopyOnWrite concurrent containers used for reading and writing less concurrency scenarios. For example whitelist, blacklist, access and update product categories scenes, not suitable for the needs strong data consistency scene.

* [ "Copy (Copy-On-Write) when written in JAVA Map implementation"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/4840107.html)
 * Separate read and write, the original data read occurs, write occurs on the copy.

 * Synchronized easy to use, compiler lock, non-lock fair.
 * ReenTrantLock flexible, lock fairness can be customized.
 * Locking the same scenario, it is recommended to use synchronized.

### mutex lock & Share

Mutex: Only one thread acquires the lock. For example, ReentrantLock are mutually exclusive lock, write lock ReadWriteLock is the mutex.
Shared lock: You can have multiple threads or locks. For example, Semaphore, CountDownLatch is shared lock, ReadWriteLock the read lock is a shared lock.

* [ "Six principles of design patterns"] (https://blog.csdn.net/q291611265/article/details/48465113)
 * Open Closed Principle: open for extension, but closed for modification, more use of abstract classes and interfaces.
 * Richter Substitution Principle: base class can replace the quilt class, abstract class inheritance, without the use of a specific class inheritance.
 * Rely on the reverse principle: to rely on the abstract, do not rely on specific interfaces for programming, not for the realization of programming.
 * Interface segregation principle: the use of multiple isolated interface, better than using a single interface to establish a minimum of interfaces.
 * Law of Demeter: a software entity should be as little interaction with other entities, to establish contact through the middle class.
 * Synthesis multiplexing principle: try to use synthetic / polymeric, instead of inheritance.

## scenarios
* [ "Around the JDK in the design pattern"] (http://blog.jobbole.com/62314/)
 * Structure pattern:
 * Adapter: an interface used to be converted into another interface, such as java.util.Arrays # asList ().
 * Bridging mode: This mode abstract and implement the abstract operation performed decoupling, such that the abstract and can vary independently implemented, such as the JDBC;
* Combination of modes: a combination of individual opinion that the client object and the object are equal. In other words, a type of method also accepts as a parameter type itself, such as Map.putAll, List.addAll, Set.addAll.
 * Decorator Pattern: object is attached to a dynamic of extra features, this is an alternative to the subclass, as java.util.Collections # checkedList | Map | Set | SortedSet | SortedMap.
 * Flyweight pattern: use cache to speed up access time for a large number of small objects, such as valueOf (int).
 * Proxy mode: proxy mode is a simple object instead of a complicated or time-consuming to create an object, such as java.lang.reflect.Proxy
 
 * Create mode:
 * Abstract factory pattern: abstract factory model provides a protocol to generate a series of related or independent objects, without specifying the specific type of object, such as java.util.Calendar # getInstance ().
 * Construction mode (Builder): definition of a new class construct instances of another class, to simplify the creation of complex objects, such as: java.lang.StringBuilder # append ().
 * Factory methods: a method ** *** is a specific object back to back, rather than several, such as java.lang.Object # toString (), java.lang.Class # newInstance ().
 * Prototype Model: instance of a class that is capable of generating a copy of itself, such as: java.lang.Object # clone ().
 * Single Mode Example: Global only one instance, such java.lang.Runtime # getRuntime ().
 * Behavior patterns:
* Chain of Responsibility pattern: the next object by forwarding the request from one object to the chain mode, until the request processing is completed, in order to achieve decoupling between objects. As javax.servlet.Filter # doFilter ().
 * Command Mode: operating encapsulated within the object, for storage, delivery and return, such as: java.lang.Runnable.
 * Interpreter pattern: define a grammar of the language, and then parse the statement corresponding syntax, such as, java.text.Format, java.text.Normalizer.
 * Iterator pattern: providing a consistent approach to the sequential access objects in the collection, as java.util.Iterator.
 * Intermediary model: By using an intermediate object to the message distribution and reduce direct dependency between classes, java.lang.reflect.Method # invoke ().
 * Null Object modes: as java.util.Collections # emptyList ().
 * Observer pattern: it allows a flexible object can send a message to an object of interest, such as java.util.EventListener.
 * Template Method pattern: Let subclass can override part of the method, rather than the entire rewriting, such as java.util.Collections # sort ().

* Zookeeper distributed lock: achieve an orderly temporary lock mechanism node, the node corresponding to their own needs a minimum, is considered to obtain a lock. Advantages: single-point cluster transparently solve the problem, the problem is not released to avoid lock, while lock can be re-entrant. Disadvantages: not as good as the performance caching mode, the throughput will zk as cluster size increases and decreases.

# Design & development model

## DDD (Domain-driven Design - Field Driven Design)

* [ "On my understanding of DDD Domain Driven Design"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/netfocus/p/5548025.html)
* The concept: DDD mainly on traditional software development process (analysis - design - coding) fragmentation problem in various stages proposed, to avoid a start analyzing the unknown or the information in the software development process flow inconsistencies caused by the software can not be delivered (and demand Fang envisaged inconsistent) problems. DDD emphasize to all areas (Domain) as the center, emphasizing the role of experts in the field (Domain Expert), emphasizing the development during the first definition of the field after a good model, and the model can guide the development of the field (the so-called drive).
 * Process: Understanding the field, the accuracy of the split areas, refining field, the model depends on the depth of understanding of the model.
 * Design: DDD proposed modeling tools, such as aggregation, entities, value objects, factory, warehouse, field service, field events to help domain modeling.
 
* [ "Domain Driven Design Basics summary"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/butterfly100/p/7827870.html)
 * Field (Doamin) is essentially the problem domain, such as an electricity supplier system, a forum system.
 * Context boundaries (Bounded Context): describes the relationship between sub-domains can be simply understood as a sub-assembly or module.
 * Domain Model (Domain Model): core DDD is to establish (language, tools Universal Description - areas of common language) correct domain model; reactive nature of business needs, including entities and processes; it runs through the software analysis, design, development the whole process; common way of expressing the domain model: FIG, code or text;
 * Areas of common language: domain experts, developers and designers can immediately language or tool.
 * Classic layered architecture: UI / presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, infrastructure layer, is a four-tier structure model.
 * Use modes:
 * Association as little as possible, as far as possible the individual, try to reduce the overall complexity.
 * Entity (Entity): field uniquely identifies a property of the entity as little as possible, at least clear.
 * Value of the object (Value Object): no unique identifier, and the attribute values ​​can not be changed, two small simple objects, such as Date.
 * Service areas (Domain Service): Coordination plurality art objects, the method is not only the state (the data does not exist); can be divided into application layer services, the field service layer, the base layer service.
 * Polymerization and polymerizing the root (Aggregate, Aggregate Root): a polymerizable group set defines the object associated with the cohesive relationship; polymeric root is the only element of the polymerization by reference; as a modified polymerization must be transaction level; most domain model, 70% of the polymerization is usually only one entity, only 30% 2-3 entity; if a polymerization only one entity, then the entity is the root of the polymer; if there are multiple entities, then we can think to which the polymerization Object meaningful independent existence and can interact directly with the outside;
 * Factory (Factory): similar to the design model of the factory model.
 * Storage (Repository): persistence to DB, managed objects, and only for the aggregation design warehouse.

* [ "Domain Driven Design (DDD) Path to Realization"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/Leo_wl/p/3866629.html)

* [ "Domain-Driven Design series (six): CQRS"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/cnblogsfans/p/4551990.html)

### anemia, congestive model

* [ "Anemia, congestive interpretation models as well as some experience"] (https://kb.cnblogs.com/page/520743/)
 * Bleeding model: father and son are defined, do not know each other, the two entities definition there is no business logic, by associating external Service.
 * Anemia Model: I know her son, I know; part of the business logic into the entity; advantages: single dependent layers, clear structure, easy to maintain; disadvantages: OO thinking does not meet, as compared to the congestion pattern, the more layer-Service thick;
* Congestion model: model and anemia are similar, except how to divide the business logic. Advantages: Service layer is thin, the only act as a Facade, DAO and not deal with complex OO ideas; Disadvantages: bidirectional dependencies between individual non-dependent, DO and DAO, Service and logical partitioning layer is likely to cause confusion.
* Swelling mode: is an extreme case, cancel the Service layer, all the business logic in the DO; Advantages: consistent with OO thinking, simplifies the hierarchical; disadvantages: too much exposure information, many non-logic will forcibly incorporated into the DO DO . This model should be avoided.
 * The author advocates the use of anemia mode.
